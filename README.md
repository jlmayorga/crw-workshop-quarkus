## Environment Access

You will be using [Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-workspaces/overview),
an online IDE. Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds,
so you don't need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, access the CodeReady Workspaces Dashboard and
log in using the username and password you've been assigned.
